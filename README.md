# Instructions to run the application

1) open cmd and navigate to the project folder.
2) run command "npm i", if already npm is installed. - this will install all dependencies.
3) run command "npm start", this will start development server, open browser and type http://localhost:8080/ will start the application.
4) to run test cases, run command "npm run test".
5) to create a public folder which contains all files which can be deployed, run command "webpack", if webpack is already installed.


#Note:-

1) I have created an async action thinking that i would be posting transaction data to server, but i forgot to implement the server and also left the async action as is, ideally async action is not required in this case. Please accept apologies.
